## Developing

### Building and publishing

The following commands allow you to build and compile your widget:

* `npm run build`: builds the production version of the widget. Creates a new extension zip file under the `zip` folder. The production version is optimized for sharing and using in production enviroments.
* `npm run upload`: creates a build, and uploads the extension zip to the thingworx server configured in `package.json`. The build is created for developement, with source-maps enabled.
* `npm run watch`: watches the source files, and whenever they change, do a build.
